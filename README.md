# ip-technical-distance-measure

This script is designed to compute the Mahalanobis distances between patents and their
respective firm-year vectors based on International Patent Classification (IPC) shares. It
operates on two datasets containing patent information and their IPC classifications. This
explanation will guide you through each part of the script, providing a clear understanding of its
function and purpose.

## Overview
The script processes two CSV files:
- MainfilrARS2.csv contains patents with their publication years, firm identifiers
(permno_adj), and IPC codes.

- MainfilrARS2_share.csv includes similar information but adds a share of IPCs for a given
patent, considering the number of IPCs associated with each patent.

# Steps in the Script
Setup and Load Data: Initializes logging for the script and loads the datasets into
Pandas DataFrames. This step is crucial for monitoring the script&#39;s progress and
debugging.

Preprocessing:

● Combines permno_adj and publn_year into a new column, permno_year, in both
datasets. This new column uniquely identifies a firm in a given year, facilitating
later analyses.

Aggregate IPC Shares:

● A function, aggregate_ipc_shares, aggregates IPC shares differently based on the dataset type (&quot;main&quot; or &quot;share&quot;).

● For &quot;main&quot;, it counts IPC occurrences per firm-year and calculates the share of
each IPC.

● For &quot;share&quot;, it sums up IPC shares per patent within firm-years.

Compute Mahalanobis Distances:

● This function, compute_mahalanobis, calculates the Mahalanobis distance between each patent&#39;s IPC share vector and its corresponding firm-year IPC share vector. The distance measures how unusual a patent&#39;s IPC distribution is compared to the typical IPC distribution of its firm in that year.

● It iterates over each patent, retrieves its IPC share vector and the corresponding firm-year vector, then calculates the distance using the inverse of the covariance matrix computed from firm-year vectors.

Yearly Processing:

● The script processes data year by year to manage computational load and account for yearly variations effectively.

● For each year, it aggregates IPC shares for both patents and firm-years,
computes the covariance matrix (and its inverse) for the firm-year data, and calculates Mahalanobis distances.

● This approach ensures that the analysis is sensitive to changes in IPC
distributions over time and reduces memory usage.

Results Compilation and Saving:

● All calculated distances are compiled into a single DataFrame, which includes permno_year, publn_nr (patent number), and the calculated Mahalanobis distance.

● This DataFrame is then saved to a CSV file, providing a comprehensive overview of the distance between individual patents and their firm-year vectors.

## Purpose and Benefits

The script&#39;s purpose is to identify patents that are unusual or innovative within the context of
their firm&#39;s typical IPC distributions. By calculating Mahalanobis distances, it quantitatively
measures the uniqueness of each patent&#39;s IPC profile relative to the aggregate profile of its firm
in a given year.

### Key Benefits

Yearly Analysis:

○ By analyzing data year by year, the script captures temporal variations in IPC distributions, ensuring the analysis remains relevant across different time periods.

Resource Efficiency:

○ Processing data in yearly chunks reduces computational demands, preventing crashes due to memory overloads.

Innovative Measure:

○ The use of Mahalanobis distance provides a sophisticated way to measure innovation and uniqueness within patents, offering valuable insights for firms and
researchers.

This script, with its detailed logging and systematic approach, offers a robust tool for analyzing
patent data, making it an invaluable asset for understanding innovation patterns across firms
and time.

## Updates (6th February)

Included the publn_nr (patent number) in the output alongside the Mahalanobis distance, modified the compute_mahalanobis function to ensure that each distance calculation is associated with its respective patent. This required a slight adjustment in aggregating and
processing of the data for each year. Here&#39;s an updated approach that includes the patent number in the final DataFrame:

Adjust the aggregation function:

○ Modify the aggregation process to keep track of publn_nr for the share data.

Update the Mahalanobis distance calculation:

○ Adjust the distance calculation to associate each distance with the correct
publn_nr.

This update includes the publn_nr in the final results, associating each Mahalanobis distance
with the specific patent it was calculated for. It uses a modified version of the aggregation
function to handle df_share differently, ensuring that publn_nr is maintained through the process
and included in the compute_mahalanobis function&#39;s output.
